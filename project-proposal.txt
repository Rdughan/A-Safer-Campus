1. Declarations
I hereby declare that the project proposal titled A SAFER CAMPUS is an original work
conducted by Dughan Richardson, Nigel Bortey and Henry Arhinkorah. This proposal is
submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Final Year Project and is not intended
for any other purpose.
2. Acknowledgements
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Dr Linda Banning, whose guidance and support
were invaluable throughout the creation of this proposal. I would also like to thank my
colleagues and team members for their collaboration and input, which significantly contributed
to shaping the vision for A SAFER CAMPUS. Additionally, I extend my thanks to my
teammates for providing the resources and support necessary to develop this proposal.
3. Dedication
This proposal is dedicated to teammates , whose encouragement, creativity and belief in our
abilities have been a constant source of motivation.
4. Abstract
A SAFER CAMPUS is a real-time, user-driven danger alert system that enables students to
report safety incidents such as robberies, altercations, and encounters with dangerous animals.
The system will aggregate these reports to generate a heatmap categorizing danger levels in
different locations based on frequency and severity. By leveraging crowd-sourced data, the
platform will provide real-time alerts and valuable insights for university security measures.
5. Problem Statement
Incidents such as muggings, assaults, and hazardous animal encounters are common in and
around campus areas. Many of these incidents go unreported, leaving students unaware of
potential dangers and making it difficult for university authorities to take proactive security
measures. Current security solutions rely heavily on patrolling and post-incident reports, which
do not effectively prevent occurrences. A real-time, student-driven alert system can bridge this
gap by:
 1. Increasing situational awareness among students.
 2. Providing university authorities with actionable security data.
 3. Creating a safer campus environment through informed decision-making.
6. Objectives
The primary focus of our proposal include
1. Developing a mobile or web-based platform where students can report safety incidents in
real-time.
2. Categorize incidents based on type (e.g., robbery, assault, snake bite, altercation) and
severity.
3. Create a dynamic heatmap displaying dangerous zones, graded with color coding for
intuitive interaction.
4. Provide real-time notifications to users based on proximity to recently reported danger
zones.
5. Enable security authorities to access and analyze data for improved response and
preventive measures.
7. Key Features
1. User Reporting Interface – Students can report incidents by selecting a category,
inputting location, time, and a brief description.
2. Real-time Alerts & Notifications – Users receive instant notifications when they are near
recently reported danger zones.
3. Heatmap Visualization – The system will display danger zones with color-coded severity
levels (e.g., red for high danger, yellow for moderate, green for safe zones).
4. Data Aggregation & Analysis – University security can view trends over time, allowing
them to make informed safety decisions.
5. Anonymous Reporting Option – To encourage more participation while ensuring privacy.
6. Integration with Emergency Services – Providing quick access to campus security or
emergency contacts.
8. Expected Impact
1. Increased Student Awareness: Real-time alerts and accessible danger zone mapping will
help students navigate safely.
2. Data-Driven Security Strategies: The university can use reported data to adjust patrol
routes and implement targeted safety measures.
3. Improved Emergency Response: Timely reports can lead to quicker interventions in case
of emergencies.
4. Community Engagement: Encouraging student participation in safety initiatives fosters a
collective security culture.
9.1 Technical Requirements
1. Platform: Web and mobile application (Android & iOS)
2. Technology Stack: React Native (mobile), Node.js (backend), Google Maps API
(location tracking & heatmap generation)
3. Database: Firebase or PostgreSQL for real-time data storage
4. Security Measures: Data encryption, role-based access control, and anonymous reporting
options
9.2 Potential Challenges and Mitigation Strategies
Challenge Mitigation Strategy
Low user participation Awareness campaigns and incentives
False reporting Verification mechanisms & user credibility
scoring
Privacy concerns Anonymous reporting and strict data
protection policies
Technical issues Regular maintenance and prompt
troubleshooting
10. Conclusion
A SAFER CAMPUS represents a transformative step in improving campus security through
technology and community participation. By implementing a student-driven danger alert system,
we can create a safer university environment while providing authorities with crucial data to
enhance security measures. We seek the university’s support in funding and policy endorsement
to bring this initiative to life.
We look forward to your support and collaboration in making our campus safer for everyone.
